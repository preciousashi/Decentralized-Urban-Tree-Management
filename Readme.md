# Decentralized Urban Tree Management

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform revolutionizes urban forestry management by creating a transparent, verifiable system for tracking urban trees throughout their lifecycle. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the system enables cities, environmental organizations, and citizens to collaborate in maintaining urban forests while quantifying their environmental and social benefits.

The platform creates an immutable record of each tree's history, from planting to maintenance activities, while calculating the ecological services provided. This data-driven approach helps optimize urban forest management, increase canopy coverage, and maximize the environmental benefits trees provide to urban communities.

## System Architecture

The system operates through four primary smart contracts:

1. **Tree Registration Contract**: Creates digital identity for each tree with location, species, and condition data
2. **Maintenance Tracking Contract**: Records all care activities performed on registered trees
3. **Benefit Calculation Contract**: Quantifies environmental services such as carbon sequestration and stormwater mitigation
4. **Planting Coordination Contract**: Determines optimal planting locations based on multiple environmental factors

## Key Features

- **Tree Digital Twins**: Every urban tree gets a unique digital identity on the blockchain
- **Transparent Maintenance**: Complete, verifiable history of all tree care activities
- **Environmental Impact Quantification**: Real-time calculation of ecosystem services provided
- **Community Participation**: Enables citizen scientists to contribute data and verify tree health
- **Data-Driven Planning**: Optimizes new planting locations for maximum environmental benefit
- **Resource Allocation**: Helps municipalities prioritize tree care based on condition and impact
- **Climate Resilience**: Supports adaptation strategies through diverse species selection
- **Public Engagement**: Connects citizens with their local urban forest through transparent data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Truffle Suite or Hardhat
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Access to target blockchain network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- IPFS client (for storing larger datasets)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urban-tree-management.git
   cd urban-tree-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your specific configuration
   ```

4. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy contracts to your chosen network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network_name]
   ```

## Smart Contract Details

### Tree Registration Contract

Manages the digital identity of urban trees:
- Unique tree ID generation
- GPS coordinates and location metadata
- Species identification and characteristics
- Tree height, diameter, and canopy width
- Planting date and estimated age
- Health condition indicators
- Site characteristics and growing conditions
- Ownership or stewardship assignment

### Maintenance Tracking Contract

Records all tree care activities:
- Pruning and maintenance history
- Treatment for pests or diseases
- Structural support installations
- Soil amendments and mulching
- Irrigation activities
- Health assessments and inspections
- Storm damage reports
- Maintenance crew identification
- Cost tracking for urban forest management

### Benefit Calculation Contract

Quantifies environmental services provided:
- Carbon sequestration calculations
- Air pollution removal estimates
- Stormwater runoff reduction
- Energy conservation impacts (shade/wind break)
- Urban heat island mitigation
- Wildlife habitat value
- Property value increases
- Human health benefits
- Monetary valuation of all services

### Planting Coordination Contract

Optimizes new tree placement:
- Site suitability analysis
- Species diversity management
- Canopy coverage optimization
- Environmental justice considerations
- Climate adaptation planning
- Root space availability assessment
- Utility and infrastructure conflict avoidance
- Growth potential modeling
- Community preference integration

## Usage Guidelines

### For Municipal Foresters

1. Register existing trees during inventory processes

3. Generate reports on ecosystem services provided
4. Identify priority areas for new plantings
5. Track tree maintenance costs and benefits
6. Monitor overall urban forest health and diversity
7. Plan for climate resilience through species selection

### For Community Organizations

1. Participate in tree stewardship programs
2. Record volunteer maintenance activities
3. Identify potential planting sites
4. Monitor tree health in specific neighborhoods
5. Access transparent data on local tree benefits
6. Coordinate community planting events
7. Track progress toward canopy coverage goals

### For Citizens

1. Locate and learn about trees in your neighborhood
2. Report tree health issues or storm damage
3. Register trees planted on private property
4. View quantified benefits of nearby trees
5. Participate in community science monitoring
6. Receive care reminders for stewarded trees
7. Verify maintenance activities conducted by city crews

## Mobile Application
